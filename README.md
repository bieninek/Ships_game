## General Information
- This project was created as a project at my university.
- The co-author of the project is [@Bart2021](https://github.com/Bart2021). My task was to create the interface menu and singleplayer. Bartek had to create multiplayer. That's the reason why <em>multiplayer</em> button doesn't work in menu.
- The game is playable, the rules are simple, you can download the .exe file and have fun!
